\section{Sensitivity Analysis}
\label{sec:sensitivity}

We test robustness with respect to MCMC parameters and dynamic weight schedules.

\subsection{MCMC Parameters}
- Increasing sample size tightens HDI widths but increases runtime linearly.  
- Higher smoothness $\lambda$ reduces week-to-week volatility, but overly large $\lambda$ can understate true shocks.

\subsection{Dynamic Weighting}
- Earlier pivot weeks emphasize technical filtering; later pivots favor fan influence.  
- The 0.7-to-0.4 schedule is stable under small shifts ($\pm 1$ week), with reversal rate nearly unchanged.

\subsection{Feature Attribution Stability}
SHAP rankings remain consistent under bootstrap resampling; judge statistics and partner effects consistently dominate.
