\subsection*{Executive Summary}

We commend the Judges' Save rule (introduced S28) for increasing dramatic tension and giving judges meaningful agency. However, our analysis reveals \textbf{model-data mismatches} in S32--S33 that warrant attention---not as evidence of wrongdoing, but as opportunities for improved transparency.

\subsection*{Key Findings}

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.1em]
    \item \textbf{S1--S31:} Our LP/MILP model achieves $S^* = 0$ (full consistency with voting rules).
    \item \textbf{S32--S33:} Constraint slack $S^* > 0$ indicates outcomes our model cannot fully explain.
    \item \textbf{Bobby Bones (S27):} Wide survival intervals ($[1\%, 91\%]$) demonstrate how the 50/50 system can protect low-scoring contestants with strong fan bases.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Possible causes for S32--33 mismatches: (1) subjective judge save criteria, (2) bottom-two selection mechanics, (3) multi-dance score aggregation.

\subsection*{Recommendations: Tiered Transparency System}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.2em]
    \item \textbf{Weighted Percent Scoring:} Adopt $0.6 \times \text{JudgePct} + 0.4 \times \text{FanPct}$. Marketing message: ``60\% skill, 40\% popularity.'' Simulations show \textbf{92.5\% reduction} in wrongful eliminations while preserving fan engagement.
    
    \item \textbf{Judge Save Transparency:} Document and announce criteria for judge save decisions (e.g., ``technical improvement shown'' or ``cumulative season performance''). This reduces perceived arbitrariness.
    
    \item \textbf{Pre-Broadcast Audit (Internal):} Run LP solver before results announcement ($<5$ sec). Flag episodes with $S^* > 0.5$ for producer review---not to change outcomes, but to prepare explanations if questioned.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Why This Matters}

The Judges' Save adds suspense and rewards quality---both valuable for entertainment. Our recommendations \emph{enhance} this by making the save more defensible and the overall system more transparent. Viewers who understand the scoring are more invested, not less.
