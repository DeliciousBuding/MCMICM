\subsection*{Bottom Line Up Front}

\textbf{Your current voting system has a transparency problem.} Our independent audit found that Seasons 32 and 33 contain elimination outcomes that cannot be fully explained by the stated scoring rules---what we call \textbf{``Mismatch Events.''}  Additionally, the Bobby Bones controversy (Season 27) demonstrates how the current 50/50 split allows contestants with dedicated fan bases to survive despite consistently low judge scores. \textbf{We recommend adopting a ``60/40 Strategy''} that rebalances judge expertise with fan engagement.

\subsection*{What We Did}

We built an automated \textbf{Consistency Checker}---think of it as a ``lie detector'' for elimination outcomes. For each episode across all 34 seasons, our system asks: \emph{``Given the judge scores and who got eliminated, is there any possible fan vote distribution that would produce this result under the stated rules?''}

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.1em]
    \item \textbf{For Seasons 1--31:} Every single elimination checks out. The math works.
    \item \textbf{For Seasons 32--33:} We found ``red flag'' episodes where \emph{no} fan vote distribution can explain the elimination under the published rules.
\end{itemize}

\noindent This doesn't mean anyone cheated---it means either (a) the rules changed in ways not publicly documented, or (b) the Judges' Save decisions introduced unpredictable factors the audience doesn't understand.

\subsection*{Three Key Findings}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.2em]
    \item \textbf{System Anomalies Detected in Recent Seasons.} \\
    Seasons 32 and 33 triggered our mismatch detector. Likely cause: the Judges' Save rule (introduced S28) operates on subjective criteria---``improvement,'' ``artistry''---that aren't captured by score-based logic. \textit{Recommendation: Publicly clarify save criteria to reduce perceived arbitrariness.}
    
    \item \textbf{The Bobby Bones Problem is Real.} \\
    In Season 27, Bobby Bones won despite averaging 5+ points below his competitors. Our analysis shows the current system \emph{structurally} allows this: a contestant needs only 25--30\% of fan votes to survive if they have even moderate judge scores. The 50/50 split gives outsized power to mobilized fan bases. \textit{Recommendation: Rebalance to protect competitive integrity.}
    
    \item \textbf{40 ``Unfair'' Eliminations Could Have Been Prevented.} \\
    We identified 40 historical eliminations where the sent-home contestant had \emph{both} above-average judge scores \emph{and} above-average estimated fan support. A simple rule change would have reduced this to just 3 cases.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Our Recommendation: The ``60/40 Strategy''}

We propose a \textbf{Weighted Scoring System}: \textbf{60\% judges, 40\% fans.}

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.1em]
    \item \textbf{Marketing Angle:} ``60\% skill, 40\% popularity---because talent should matter.''
    \item \textbf{Impact:} Reduces ``unfair'' eliminations from 40 to just 3 across all seasons.
    \item \textbf{Flexibility:} Works across the range of 55--65\% judge weight; 60\% is the sweet spot.
    \item \textbf{Fan Engagement:} Still keeps fans invested---their votes matter, just not overwhelmingly.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Operational Tools We Can Provide}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.1em]
    \item \textbf{Pre-Broadcast Checker:} Run before results air (under 5 seconds). Flags episodes that might generate controversy.
    \item \textbf{Media Q\&A Prep:} For flagged episodes, generates talking points explaining why an ``upset'' outcome is mathematically possible.
    \item \textbf{Season-End Report:} Summarizes voting patterns and anomaly rates for internal review.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Important Caveats}

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.1em]
    \item We never see actual vote counts---our analysis produces \emph{possible ranges}, not exact numbers.
    \item Mismatch events signal rule complexity, \textbf{not} manipulation.
    \item Post-Season 27 rule details are inferred; official documentation may differ.
\end{itemize}
