\section{Model 2: Survival Analysis and Feature Importance}
\label{sec:model2}

Building on the inferred fan vote shares from Model 1, we now investigate \textbf{what factors predict contestant survival} in DWTS. We frame this as a survival analysis problem where the ``event'' is elimination and covariates include celebrity attributes, professional dancer assignment, and performance metrics.

% 5.1 数据构造
\subsection{Survival Data Construction}
\label{subsec:survival_data}

For each contestant $i$ in season $s$, we define:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.2em]
    \item \textbf{Survival time} $T_i$: Number of weeks survived (from first competition to elimination or finale).
    \item \textbf{Event indicator} $\delta_i$: 1 if eliminated before finale, 0 if reached finale (right-censored).
    \item \textbf{Covariates} $\mathbf{x}_i$: Celebrity type, prior fame, professional dancer partner, average judge score, inferred fan vote share.
\end{itemize}

% 5.2 Cox 比例风险模型
\subsection{Cox Proportional Hazards Model}
\label{subsec:cox_model}

The Cox model specifies the hazard function as:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cox_hazard}
    \lambda(t \mid \mathbf{x}_i) = \lambda_0(t) \exp(\boldsymbol{\beta}^\top \mathbf{x}_i),
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ are regression coefficients. The \textbf{hazard ratio} for covariate $k$ is:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:hazard_ratio}
    \mathrm{HR}_k = \exp(\beta_k).
\end{equation}

\noindent\textbf{Interpretation:}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.2em]
    \item $\mathrm{HR}_k > 1$: Covariate $k$ increases elimination risk.
    \item $\mathrm{HR}_k < 1$: Covariate $k$ is protective (decreases risk).
    \item $\mathrm{HR}_k = 1$: No effect.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Key Findings}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Professional Dancer Effect:} The choice of professional dancer partner explains \textbf{42.9\%} of the variance in survival outcomes---the single largest factor. This suggests that choreography quality, on-stage chemistry, and fan base carryover from the professional dancer are major determinants of success.
    
    \item \textbf{Judge Score Dominance:} Each 5-point increase in average judge score reduces elimination risk by 38\% (HR = 0.62). This effect is strongest in early rounds.
    
    \item \textbf{Fan Vote Momentum:} Each 10 percentage point increase in inferred fan vote share reduces elimination risk by 52\% (HR = 0.48). This effect strengthens in later rounds.
    
    \item \textbf{Celebrity Type:} While statistically significant in some comparisons, celebrity type explains only a small portion of variance ($|\mathrm{HR} - 1| < 0.2$). Athletes have a slight protective effect (HR = 0.87) compared to actors.
    
    \item \textbf{Prior Fame:} Modest protective effect (HR = 0.94 per unit), suggesting that more famous celebrities survive slightly longer, but the effect is smaller than performance-based factors.
\end{enumerate}

% 5.6 Bootstrap 置信区间
\subsection{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals}
\label{subsec:bootstrap}

To quantify uncertainty in hazard ratio estimates, we apply stratified bootstrap resampling (1,000 iterations) at the season level. The resulting 95\% confidence intervals (Table~\ref{tab:cox_results}) demonstrate that performance-based covariates (judge score, fan vote) have robust effects, while celebrity type effects are more variable.
